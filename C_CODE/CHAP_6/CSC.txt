Cumulative Skills Check - Chapter 6 - 2/3
-------------------------------------------------------MY ANSWERS----------------------

1) In some applications, pointers are faster than array indexing. 
	However in the modern age, compilers have become pretty smart to the point where both can be equally optimized by the compiler, so array indexing isn't that much slower anymore.

2) Done in CSC-2.C and CSC-2.exe

3) *(count + 44*10 + 8) = 99;

----------------------------------CHECKING FROM ANSWERS AT THE BACK OF THE BOOK--------------------

1) Pointers are also sometimes convenient, but otherwise correct

2) Refactored code that does identically the same thing. Correct.

3) An (int *) cast needs to be applied, you lack understanding behind how multidimensional arrays can be thought of as as a single array OF TYPE int [][]... Incorrect.
	The correct answer is *((int *)count + 44*10 + 8) = 99;


Whee, after studying a bit about type casts in multidimensional arrays, we can move on to
