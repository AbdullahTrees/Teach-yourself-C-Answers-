Review Skills Check - Chapter 2 - 9.5/10
-------------------------------------------------------MY ANSWERS----------------------

1) All programs must have main(). The program initializes and starts following the first instructions from main().

2) Done, Check RSC-2.C and RSC-2.exe

3) We type the following line to tell the compiler we want TEST.H as a header file at the very beginning of the code.

#include <TEST.H>

4) float, int, char, double and void

5)	a - valid
	b - invalid because a variable name can't start with a number
	c - invalid cause a variable name can't contain symbols
	d - valid
	e - invalid cause a variable name can't contain symbols

6) scanf() is used to take inputs from the command prompt and store them inside variables.

7) Done, Check RSC-7.C and RSC-7.exe

8) Comments are entered by adding /* and */ before and after the comment. For example,

/* this is a comment and here I can type whatever I want */

9) The function has to exit with the following instruction 

	return 'value';
Whatever encapsulates this 'value' is then the value that is returned to the routine that called it.

10) Prototype of Myfunc()

	void Myfunc(int count, float balance, char ch);

----------------------------------CHECKING FROM ANSWERS AT THE BACK OF THE BOOK--------------------

1) Correct
2) Expected Output, slightly different approach. Consensus: Correct
3) #include is called a 'Compiler directive' and you should remember that, other than that correct. Example correct.
4) Correct
5) Correct
6) scanf() function is used to take input information *from the keyboard*. Consensus: Almost Correct(75%) as the initial answer implies that mouse inputs would be possible, which is false
7) Expected Output, different approach. Consensus: Overengineered but correct.
8) Correct Example and answer
9) Correct 
10) Correct
