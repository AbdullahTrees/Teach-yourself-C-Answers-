Cumulative Skills Check - Chapter 4 - 5/6
-------------------------------------------------------MY ANSWERS----------------------

1) Thank you question, I forgot that you can't have two same cases in a switch... but I do remember that 'A' and 65 are essentially the same thing at the memory level, so this switch is INVALID

2) char variables are smaller than the size of int variables, so any integer that returns smaller than the size of char will be the same as if it was char.

3) This loop never terminates as i overflows once it increments above 32767, making it go down to -32767, which is less than 33000, and this continues on forever (i can never reach 33000 and become larger)

----------------------------------CHECKING FROM ANSWERS AT THE BACK OF THE BOOK--------------------

1) INVALID is right, Correct

2) The reason that the return value of getchar() or getche() can be assigned to a char is because C automatically removes the high-order byte.

3) Correct,
